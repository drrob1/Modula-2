<trijezdci> hi ttmrichter
<trijezdci> do you want to have a laugh?
<trijezdci> http://modula2.net/temp/what-goes-around-comes-around.txt
<ttmrichter> Preparing to laugh.  Hold on.
<ttmrichter> A recruiter asked you to pass on the name of a company that fucked up your interview?!
<ttmrichter> Jesus!  That would be like that shithole outfit in Xiamen asking me for a reference.
<ttmrichter> I'd give 'em a reference alright.
<ttmrichter> Right between the eyes.
<Jomu> trijezdci looks well. except I still like single whitespace more :)
<trijezdci> ttmrichter: no, a recruiter asked if I would consider a permanent role in a company that had fucked up an interview for me last year
<ttmrichter> A permanent role in a company that couldn't contend with a temporary one?
<trijezdci> I said that I wasn't interested in permanent roles unless its C-level, but that I have colleagues who do not like the fact that they have to transfer to Huawei as a result of a terminated outsourcing agreement (Huawei being the new supplier of our customer) and that I may pass on the job description to anyone who tells me they would rather like to find another job than go to Huawei
<trijezdci> when I then received the job description and became aware what the company is, I wrote this as a reply
<trijezdci> anyway, what goes around comes around
<trijezdci> Dimension Data is not a company I will have anything to do with
<trijezdci> and they will not get any referrals from me
<trijezdci> nor will they be getting any business from any of the clients I work and will work for if I am in the decision making seat
<trijezdci> that company is on my blackhole list

<trijezdci> Jomu, lexically, underscore is not a problem, but whitespace is
<trijezdci> because a literal is terminated by whitespace, this would require extra lookahead
<trijezdci> with underscore you just collect all underscores and flag an error if you find anything other than a digit after it
<ttmrichter> Oh, you're allowing underscores in numbers?  I remember asking for that, but forgot you'd agreed.
<trijezdci> if underscore becomes part of a number literal then underscore can no longer terminate a number literal
<trijezdci> but if whitespace becomes part of a number literal, it will still also be able to terminate a number literal
<trijezdci> that is a problem, so whitespace is a no no
<trijezdci> ttmrichter: not yet, but it is under discussion
<trijezdci> it could look like so ...
<trijezdci> decimalNumber :
<trijezdci>     significand ( fraction exponent? )?
<trijezdci> significand :
<trijezdci>     digit+ ( "_" digit+ )*
<trijezdci> fraction :
<trijezdci>     "." digit+ ( "_" digit+ )*
<trijezdci> exponent :
<trijezdci>     ( "e" | "E" ) ( "+" | "-" ) digit+ ( "_" digit+ )?
<trijezdci> and accordingly for base 16 and base 2 literals
<ttmrichter> That's really nice.
<ttmrichter> That allows for digit grouping for readability.
<trijezdci> this would only impact the lexer
<ttmrichter> $HDEAD_BEEF
<ttmrichter> (Or whatever the hex constants looked like again.)
<trijezdci> more like 0xdead_beef and 0_DEAD_BEEFH
<ttmrichter> Ah, right.
<trijezdci> C and M2 style
<ttmrichter> 0_CAFE_BABEH
<trijezdci> heh
<ttmrichter> But really, being able to group digits is a life-saver.
<trijezdci> for embedded work using base 2 literals it is really important to have some digit separation
<ttmrichter> In hex constants it allows you to group by 4-bit fields.
<ttmrichter> For ... yeah, I was about to say with reference to bit fields.
<trijezdci> underscore may not be the most beautiful solution but it has precedence
<trijezdci> in Ada and in Mod51
<ttmrichter> And quite a few other languages.
<trijezdci> Mod51 implements Ada literals
<ttmrichter> And I agree, it's not the most beautiful, but it is the most accessible.
<trijezdci> #2#0110_1100_1010
<ttmrichter> I think I encountered this the first time in Eiffel.
<trijezdci> if we were to compete with COBOL, I'd do something like this
<trijezdci> CONST amount = &(12,345,678);
<trijezdci> CONST amount = &(12,345,678.0000);
<trijezdci> CONST amount = &(12,345,678.000_015);
<trijezdci> CONST amount = &(1.234,567,8.0E+123,456);
<trijezdci> CONST amount = &( **,*12,345.000);
<trijezdci> CONST amount = &(-**,*12,345.000);
<trijezdci> but I think underscore should be sufficient
<ttmrichter> Um... no.
<ttmrichter> No fucking way.
<ttmrichter> Absolutely no fucking way.
<ttmrichter> I would hunt you down and slaughter you in your sleep.
<trijezdci> like I said, this would be COBOL terrain
<ttmrichter> Or, worse, I'd throw Indian numbering formats at you.
<trijezdci> we could always go back to roman numerals I suppose :)
<ttmrichter> I think Indian numbering systems would confuse you more.
<ttmrichter> Like how they're sometimes grouped in threes, sometimes in pairs.
<ttmrichter> With no discernable rhyme or reason to it.
<trijezdci> Apple script had an interesting convention using whitespace in literals and identifiers when enclosing them in vertical bars
<trijezdci> like
<trijezdci> |this is an identifier|
<ttmrichter> That's borrowed from Prolog and its family.
<trijezdci> ah ok
<ttmrichter> this_is_an_atom
<ttmrichter> thisIsAlsoAnAtom
<ttmrichter> 'This is an atom too'
<ttmrichter> Within single quotes you can have *ANYTHING*.
<trijezdci> yeah, but I didn't want to sacrifice the ' for strings
<ttmrichter> And since all identifiers are atoms, it logically means you can have identifiers like ' ' and '  ' and '   ' giving you LOADS of room for obfuscating code!  :D
<trijezdci> otherwise you could use 
<trijezdci> ' as a digit separator
<ttmrichter> Yeah, underscores are fine.
<trijezdci> 123'456.789
<ttmrichter> They're easily readable and they're not used in other places very much.
<ttmrichter> Identifiers ... and that's about it, right?
<trijezdci> yes
<trijezdci> and of course you can have underscores inside strings too
<ttmrichter> Well you can have anything inside strings.
<ttmrichter> But any decent lexer generator will deal with that for you.
<trijezdci> anything ASCII printable
<ttmrichter> ANTLR's quite good at it, for example.
<trijezdci> while we are doing the editorial review now, Rick is asking some funny questions once in a while
<trijezdci> is PROCEDURE Foo ( a : CARDINAL; b : ARRAY [0..a] OF Bar); still valid?
<trijezdci> my answer
<trijezdci> No, because we do not have ARRAY [n..m]
<trijezdci> there were a number of those where I had to answer int his way "No because we have thrown out this feature, rememeber?!"
<trijezdci> of course in the above one he'll come back asking
<trijezdci> is PROCEDURE Foo (a : CARDINAL; b : ARRAY a OF Bar) still valid
<trijezdci> which probably doesn't make sense in a language that has strict name equivalence anyway
<trijezdci> nothing would be compatible with b

* ttmrichter is being sarcastic about traditional software development cycles here.
<trijezdci> heh
<trijezdci> Rick has only reviewed up to page 60 yet
<trijezdci> of course most of the remainder after that is not text but tables and appendices w grammar and diagrams etc
<trijezdci> so there will be another 25 or 30 pages of text to go through
<trijezdci> possibly leading to another 15-20 issues
<trijezdci> anyway, those issues are almost all editorial
<trijezdci> polishing the text, not the design
<trijezdci> we have one issue that requires two more constants to be added to pseudo-module COMPILER
<ttmrichter> Have you decided on 1_234_567 yet?
<trijezdci> not yet
<trijezdci> I don't want to distract Rick now from the document review
<trijezdci> ttmrichter: what do you think about issue #20
<trijezdci> ?
<ttmrichter> I don't think array access notation implies an ordered collection myself.
<ttmrichter> Of course I'm used to languages dating back to SNOBOL4 where arrays were associative, not sequenced.
<trijezdci> and what about the choice of array notation instead of EXCL(set, elem) and INCL(set, elem)
<trijezdci> ?
<trijezdci> ttmrichter: ?
* xpololz (~xpo@80.203.124.203) has joined #modula-2
<ttmrichter> Sorry.  Hit by major heat fatigue here.
<ttmrichter> I prefer the array notation.

<trijezdci> ttmrichter: it has been suggested that we should drop variadic calling convention #2 (explicit variadic counter) to reduce complexity
<trijezdci> this is a convention only really intended for mapping to C APIs where there is a variadic counter but not immediately before the variadic list
<trijezdci> those cases are admittedly rare in C APIs but they do exist
<ttmrichter> Given that C is currently *the* lingua franca of computing, you should keep it.
<ttmrichter> http://www.txt.io/t-2fw4y
<trijezdci> I was thinking of alternatives
<trijezdci> first, we only need to support mapping to a C function that has such an oddball signature
<trijezdci> we do not need to support implementing such an oddball function in M2
<trijezdci> I think
<trijezdci> if we follow this line of thought, we could imagine a pragma to modify the semantics of the regular use case #1
<trijezdci> for example
<trijezdci> mapping to a C function like this:
<trijezdci> void Foo( unsigned count, char ch, ... );
<trijezdci> where the counter is not immediately before the variadic list
<trijezdci> could be done with a pragma like so:
<trijezdci> PROCEDURE Foo ( <* VCOUNT=CARDINAL *> ch : CHAR; v : VARIADIC OF INTEGER ) <* FFI="C" *>;
<trijezdci> you could map to the C function this way, but you couldn't implement the oddball in M2
<trijezdci> which is probably a good thing
<trijezdci> this VCOUNT pragma would only be legal if the FFI="C" pragma is specified for the scope
<trijezdci> what do you think of this?
<trijezdci> ttmrichter: M2 uses quite a few lines for hello-world too
<ttmrichter> I pointed that out.  But I also pointed out how much the ceremony *scales* is the important point.
<ttmrichter> If, like Java or C++, every line you add involves more ceremony, then you've got a problem.
* javar (~javier@227.pool85-55-39.dynamic.orange.es) has joined #modula-2
<trijezdci> ttmrichter: what do you think about that pragma approach?
<ttmrichter> I'd actually find that more complex than the use of an alternative syntax.
<trijezdci> the downside of proper syntax is that it increases the volume of possible procedure types that must be checked for assigning procedures to procedure variables
<trijezdci> and you need support for implementation, not just mapping to C
<trijezdci> I like the idea of not being able to implement the oddball C use cases in M2 but only map to them
<ttmrichter> Making C interop difficult kills languages dead, unfortunately.
<trijezdci> a pragma seems to be better suited to a) not allowing implementation, only mapping and b) not allowing assignment to procedure variables
<trijezdci> yeah, its a drag
* javar has quit (Quit: javar)
<trijezdci> another concern is that if you make this proper syntax, then users will want to use it for Modula-2 implementations
<trijezdci> whereas this is a use case that shouldn't be implemented but only mapped to if some idiot felt they have to do such an oddball function in C
<ttmrichter> That's a fair concern.  You could mandate that use of it outside the context of an FFI pragma is a mandatory warning?
* javar (~javier@227.pool85-55-39.dynamic.orange.es) has joined #modula-2
<trijezdci> well, it if was a pragma, then the pragma would only be legal if it was within the scope of an FFI="C" pragma
<trijezdci> either module scope or procedure scope
<ttmrichter> Actually there's a part of me that says variadic functions are unnecessary if you have, you know, arrays.  :D
<trijezdci> not for the kind of use cases used in Cocoa with values and keys
<ttmrichter> That's FFI.
<trijezdci> initWithValuesAndKeys( "foo", 123, "bar", 345, "baz", 567 )
<trijezdci> well, I am bringing this on as a legit use case for variadics
<trijezdci> you have alternatiing types there
<trijezdci> keysAndValues actually
<trijezdci> but anyway
<trijezdci> this you'd have to use an array of a record with two components
<ttmrichter> That's where tuples would be a nice construct.
<trijezdci> then you'd have oodles of curly braces
<trijezdci> InitWithKeysAndValues( { {"foo", 123}, {"bar", 234}, ...})
<ttmrichter> Or parens.  Technically you can view a function foo(a,b,c,d) as a function invocation foo with a single tuple parameter.
<ttmrichter> With syntax sugar on the definition side for directly accessing named members.
<trijezdci> but that requires a completely different type equivalence system
<trijezdci> strict name equiv is out the window
<trijezdci> which has other drawbacks
<ttmrichter> You've got a few other structural equivalence systems in there already, no?
<trijezdci> we do allow this {} notation for the entire variadic list though
<trijezdci> I have looked at tuples as types and other approaches,  trust me, this one we have now is the most straightforward
<trijezdci> the only trouble are the odd 0.00001% use cases in C
<trijezdci> to be mapped from M2
<trijezdci> the vast majority of uses of variadics in C use a list terminator value
<trijezdci> we cover that nicely
<trijezdci> its just those very very rare counter use cases where the counter isn't immediately before the variadic args
<trijezdci> and people seem to be confused when they read the spec
<trijezdci> because they can't easily tell the difference between 1 and 2
<trijezdci> the immediatly before varargs and not immediately before varargs counter
<trijezdci> plus, you can at present implement the 2nd case (not immediately before the varargs)
<trijezdci> once this gets into the code base and becomes legacy code, you can't remove the feature easily then
<trijezdci> and people should only be using #1 and #2 uses
<ttmrichter> Yeah, given that you want to discourage that style in M2 proper, but need it for the weird edge cases of C APIs from Hell, perhaps the pragma approach is best then.
<trijezdci> yeah, need to sleep over this some more
<trijezdci> it also would allow mapping to printf and consorts
<trijezdci> <*VCOUNT=NONE*>
<trijezdci> you certainly wouldn't want to allow that to be implemented in M2 proper

<trijezdci> heh
<trijezdci> Springer is considering printing the Modula-2 R10 spec
<trijezdci> same publishing house as Wirth's PIM
<trijezdci> but we may have to add a non-specification part like in Wirth's PIM
<javar> Springer is a prestigious publisher 
<trijezdci> indeed
<ttmrichter> Yeah, I'd go through whatever hoops they'd want you to go through.
<ttmrichter> Get your name published by Springer, get a lot of prestige.
<ttmrichter> I assume the "non-specification part" is an informal discussion of the structure and semantics?

<trijezdci> ttmrichter: WIrth's PIM is structured into two parts
<trijezdci> one is a general programming text using Modula-2
<trijezdci> the other is the language description
<trijezdci> I guess Springer are used to that formal
<trijezdci> format
<ttmrichter> Yeah, that's a good format anyway.
<trijezdci> they probably don't see themselves as an O'Reilly type publishing house
<trijezdci> they probably want a bit more than just a technical specification
<ttmrichter> Are you soliciting writing for the general portion?
<trijezdci> we could do either of two things
<trijezdci> 1) do like Wirth, add a general programming part
<trijezdci> 2) write about how we designed the revision
<trijezdci> what challenges we faced, what the objectives were, how we accomplished what we did
<trijezdci> I need to wait until Springer get back to me and let me know their ideas
<trijezdci> then I will discuss with Rick how we go about it
<trijezdci> if there needs to be a general programming part added, I guess Rick will want to take the lead on that because that is his field, he's already written a couple of Modula-2 books
<trijezdci> but if we can get a deal with Springer that would be fantastic
<trijezdci> it would lend so much credibility to the project
<trijezdci> after all that's where PIM was released
<trijezdci> so we'd sort of get an official seal of approval to continue the PIM line
<trijezdci> then if Wirth also agrees to write the foreword, it would seal the succession
<trijezdci> even the ISO Modula-2 official website now lists us as a new standardisation effort
<trijezdci> this is what I like about reviving a dead language
<trijezdci> you get all the name recognition but don't have to worry about installed base
<trijezdci> imagine you would do as many changes as we did but for a language still in use
<trijezdci> and you're not the original author
<trijezdci> you'd get quartered, hanged and shot
<trijezdci> I think I have figured out how to map to printf and consorts
<trijezdci> PROCEDURE printf( fmt : ARRAY OF CHAR; p :  SYSTEM.OPENARGLIST ) <* FFI="C" *>;
<trijezdci> or maybe UNSAFEARGLIST
<trijezdci> yeah I like that one
<trijezdci> it has the word FEAR in it
<trijezdci> very appropriate
<trijezdci> PROCEDURE printf( fmt : ARRAY OF CHAR; p :  SYSTEM.UNSAFEARGLIST ) <* FFI="C" *>;
