PROCEDURE RETBLKBUF(CNT : WORD; VAR OUT BUF : BUFTYP);
(*
******************************* RETBLKBUF ***********************************
RETURN BLANK BUFFER.
THIS ROUTINE IS USED TO RETURN A BLANK BUFFER THAT IS USED TO INDENT THE OUTPUT
LINE BY AS MANY SPACES AS NEEDED.  ROUTINE IS NEEDED PRIMARILY FOR WRRTN AND
ANWORD'S MAIN BODY.

INPUT FROM GBLVAR'S : BLANK, BUFSIZ
*)

PROCEDURE FWRBL(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP; CNT : WORD);
(*
******************************* FWRBL ***********************************
Fast file WRite Blanks.
This routine is used to write CNT number of blanks to file F.

INPUT FROM GBLVAR'S : BLANK, BUFSIZ
*)

PROCEDURE EXTRACTDRVPTH(BUF:BUFTYP; VAR OUT DRVPATH:BUFTYP);
(*
****************************** EXTRACTDRVPTH *******************************
EXTRACT DRIVE AND PATH PROCEDURE.
THIS PROCEDURE EXTRACTS THE DRIVE AND PATH SPECIFICATION PRESENT IN BUF AND
TRANSFERS THEM TO THE DRVPATH PARAM.
*)

PROCEDURE FWRSTR(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP; CHARRAY : ARRAY OF CHAR);
(*
************************* FWRSTR ********************************************
File WRITE STRING.
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE IS TO ALLOW EASY OUTPUT OF STRINGS.  IT IS
IMPLEMENTED WITH CALLS TO CONBUF AND FWRTX, BUT PUTTING IT HERE SIMPLIFIES
THE I/O FOR THE USER.
*)

PROCEDURE FWRLN(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP);
(*
************************* FWRLN *********************************************
File WRITE LINE.
THIS ROUTINE WILL WRITE A <CR>, <LF> SEQUENCE
*)

PROCEDURE FWRLF(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP);
(*
************************* FWRLF *********************************************
File WRite <lf>
THIS ROUTINE WILL WRITE A <LF> character, to convert from DOS to Linux.
*)

PROCEDURE FOPEN(VAR INOUT F:MYFILTYP; FILNAM:BUFTYP; RDWRSTATE:IOSTATE);

PROCEDURE FRESET(VAR INOUT F:MYFILTYP; FILNAM:BUFTYP; RDWRSTATE:IOSTATE; HaltOnError:BOOLEAN);
(*
************************ FRESET **************************************
FAST RESET ROUTINE.
THIS PROCEDURE OPENS THE FILE FOR I/O, USING THE LOGITECH PROCEDURES LOOKUP
AND RESET.  FILNAM IS THE FILE NAME AS BUILT BY GETFNM.  UNLIKE THE PASCAL
PROCEDURE OF THE SAME NAME, THIS ROUTINES OPENS AND RESETS FILES FOR BOTH
READING AND WRITING.  RDWRSTATE IS EITHER RD FOR OPEN A FILE FOR READING,
OR WR FOR OPEN A FILE FOR WRITING.
*)

PROCEDURE FREAD(VAR F:MYFILTYP; VAR EOFFLG:BOOLEAN);
(*
****************************** FREAD *************************************
Fast READ.
This procedure will read the proper number of characters into the IOBUF.
*)

PROCEDURE FRDTXLN(VAR INOUT F:MYFILTYP; VAR OUT BUF:BUFTYP; LNMAX:CARDINAL);
(*
****************************** FRDTXLN *******************************
File READ TEXT LINE.
THIS ROUTINE FUNCTIONS LIKE ITS SLOWER COUNTERPART, ONLY IT GETS ITS
TEXT LINE FROM THE I/O BUFFER AND NOT FROM THE CURRENT INPUT DEVICE.
LIKE ITS SLOWER COUNTERPART, THIS ROUTINE MORE CLOSELY APPROXIMATES
THE READ OF FORTRAN, WITH ITS READING AN ENTIRE LINE, AND TESTING FOR
THE END OF FILE CONDITION.

F  --THE FILE VARIABLE FOR THE FILE TO WHICH DATA IS TO BE WRITTEN.
BUF--THE BUFFER OF CHARS TO BE WRITTEN TO FILE F.
LNMAX-- Max amt of chars allowed per text line buffer.
EOFFLG--FLAG INDICATING WHETHER THE END OF FILE HAS BEEN FOUND.
*)

PROCEDURE FWRTX(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP; BUF : BUFTYP);
(*
****************************** FWRTX **************************************
File WRITE TEXT LINE.
THIS ROUTINE FUNCTIONS LIKE ITS SLOWER COUNTERPART, ONLY IT PUTS ITS
TEXT LINE INTO THE I/O BUFFER AND NOT TO THE CURRENT OUTPUT DEVICE.
LIKE ITS SLOWER COUNTERPART, THIS ROUTINE MORE CLOSELY APPROXIMATES
THE WRITE OF FORTRAN, WITH ITS WRITING AN ENTIRE LINE, AND TESTING FOR
THE END OF FILE CONDITION.  ALSO, IT DIFFERS FROM FWRTXLN IN THAT THE
<CR> AND <LF> CHAR'S ARE NOT WRITTEN TO IOBUF.

F  --THE FILE VARIABLE FOR THE FILE TO WHICH DATA IS TO BE WRITTEN.
BUF--THE BUFFER OF CHARS TO BE WRITTEN TO FILE F.
*)

PROCEDURE FPURGE(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP);
(*
**************************** FPURGE *************************************
Fast Purge.
This routine will unconditionally write the IOBUF out to disk.
*)

PROCEDURE FWRTXLN(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP; BUF : BUFTYP);
(*
****************************** FWRTXLN **************************************
File WRITE TEXT LINE.
THIS ROUTINE FUNCTIONS LIKE ITS SLOWER COUNTERPART, ONLY IT PUTS ITS
TEXT LINE INTO THE I/O BUFFER AND NOT TO THE CURRENT OUTPUT DEVICE.
LIKE ITS SLOWER COUNTERPART, THIS ROUTINE MORE CLOSELY APPROXIMATES
THE WRITE OF FORTRAN, WITH ITS WRITING AN ENTIRE LINE, AND TESTING FOR
THE END OF FILE CONDITION.

F  --THE FILE VARIABLE FOR THE FILE TO WHICH DATA IS TO BE WRITTEN.
BUF--THE BUFFER OF CHARS TO BE WRITTEN TO FILE F.
*)

PROCEDURE FCLOSE(VAR INOUT F : MYFILTYP);
(*
******************************* FCLOSE **************************************
File CLOSE.
THIS ROUTINE WILL CLOSE THE FILE INPUT AS ITS FORMAL PARAMETER.  IF THE BUFFER
IS A WRITE BUFFER, THE BUFFER WILL BE WRITTEN BEFORE CLOSURE.
*)


PROCEDURE COPYDPIF(INFNAM : BUFTYP; VAR OUT OUTFNAM : BUFTYP);
(*
**************************** COPYDPIF ***********************************
COPY Drive and Path IF there is no drive or path already there.  That is,
this procedure will first check to see of the output file name has a drive
or path specification.  If so, then nothing else is done.  If not, then
the drive and path specification used for the input file will be copied to
the output file name.
*)

PROCEDURE FAPPEND(VAR INOUT F:MYFILTYP; FILNAM:BUFTYP);
(*
*********************** FAPPEND *****************************************
File APPEND.
This procedure will open the file given in FILNAM as an output file, and
whatever is written to this file is appended to the file, instead of
overwriting it.
*)


PROCEDURE GETFNM(PROMPT,NAMDFT,TYPDFT : BUFTYP; VAR OUT FILNAM : BUFTYP);
(*
********************************** GETFNM *******************************
GET FILE NAME SUBROUTINE.
THIS ROUTINE WILL GET A FILE NAME FROM THE TERMINAL, AND ALLOW DEFAULTS
FOR THE ENTIRE FILE NAME AND/OR THE EXTENSION.
PROMPT--THIS IS THE PROMPT TO BE PRINTED TO THE TERMINAL BEFORE THE
      FILENAME IS REQUESTED.  IT MUST HAVE A COLON, : , AS ITS LAST
      CHARACTER TO OPERATE NORMALLY.
NAMDFT--THIS IS THE NAME DEFAULT STRING THAT HAS THE FILE NAME THAT WILL
      BE USEDIF NO INPUT NAME IS ENTERED.  THIS MUST HAVE THE .EXT AS
      WELL AS THE NAME PART; THE TYPDFT WILL NOT BE APPENDED TO THE
      DEFAULT NAME.
TYPDFT--IS A 4 BYTE ARRAY THAT IS THE DEFAULT TYPE (EXTENSION) OF THE
      FILE.  IF A DOT IS NOT PRESENT IN THE INPUT CHARACTER STRING,
      THIS ARRAY WILL BE APPENDED TO THE INPUT STRING TO YIELD THE
      FULL FILENAME.
FILNAM--IS THE OUTPUT FILENAME THAT IS A COMBINATION OF THE INPUT
    STRING, THE TYPE DEFAULT, AND THE NAME DEFAULT, AS IS APPROPRIATE.

FUNCTION VALUE RETURNED WILL BE FALSE IF THE DEFAULT NAME WAS USED, I.E.,
NO NAME WAS INPUT FROM TERMINAL.  FUNCTION VALUE WILL BE TRUE OTHERWISE.
  IF A NAME IS INPUT WITHOUT AN EXTENSION, BEFORE THE DEFAULT EXTENSION IS
APPENDED, IT IS STORED IN THE TMPNAM BUFFER.  WHEN NO STRING IS INPUT, THIS
NAME WITH THE DEFAULT EXTENSION APPENDED IS USED BEFORE THE FULL DEFAULT NAME
IS.

INPUT FROM GBL VAR'S:  NULL, BLANK.
*)

END MyFIO2.
