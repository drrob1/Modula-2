GET OPCODE.
THIS ROUTINE RECEIVES A TOKEN OF FSATYP OP (MEANING IT IS AN OPERATOR)
AND ANALYZES IT TO DETERMINE AN OPCODE, WHICH IS A CARDINAL FROM 1..11.
THIS IS DONE AFTER THE NECESSARY VALIDITY CHECK OF THE INPUT TOKEN.
THE OPCODE ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE OP TOKENS ARE:
  < is 1                  <= is 2
  > is 3                  >= is 4
  = is 5   == is 5        <> is 6    # is 7
  + is 8                  += is 9
  - is 10                 -= is 11
  * is 12                 *= is 13
  / is 14                 /= is 15

THEIR MEANINGS ARE DERIVED FROM A COMBINATION FROM 3 COMPUTER LANGUAGES:
C, PASCAL, AND MODULA-2, AND SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT.

*************************** GETTKN **************************************

THIS IS THE GET NEXT TOKEN ROUTINE.  A TOKEN IS A STRING OF SYMBOLS THAT
REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY, LIKE A CHAR STRING REPRESENTING A PARAM
NAME OR A DIGIT STRING REPRESENTING A NUMBER.  EACH TOKEN IS DELIMITED BY THE
DELIMITERS RECOGNIZED BY NXTCHR (COMMA, EQUALS SIGN, OR END-OF-TKNBUF COND).
THIS ROUTINE WILL DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THE TOKEN AND WHETHER IT IS A
CHARACTER TOKEN OR A NUMBER TOKEN.

TOKEN -- BUFFER HOLDING THE CHARACTERS OF THIS TOKEN.
SUM   -- CONTAINS THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER IN A NUMBER TOKEN, HAS THE
          SUM OF THE ASCII VALUES FOR A CHARACTER TOKEN, OR HAS THE OPCODE
          VALUE FOR AN OP TOKEN.
RETCOD2--RETURN CODE.  0: Normal return; 1: No more tokens on line;

************************ GETTKNREAL ***************************************
GET ToKeN REAL.
This behaves very similarly to GETTKN, only that all numbers are returned as
reals instead of integers.  Since it uses GETTKN to first see if there is a
dgt token, this rtn can be used instead of GETTKN if a real number token is
possible.  It returns the same codes as GETTKN, with an additional code of 7
if the real token is invalid (the StringToReal conversion failed).

RETCOD2--RETURN CODE.  0: Normal return; 1: No more tokens on line;
          2: Char token too long; 3: Number token with too many digits;

PROCEDURE GETTKNSTR(VAR tpv : TKNPTRTYP; VAR TOKEN:BUFTYP; VAR INTVAL:LONGINT; VAR RETCOD2:CARDINAL);
(*
  GET ToKeN STRing.
  Will get tokens only stopping at a delimiter, unlike GETTKN, and all
  tokens are of state ALLELSE, so no state need be returned.  First will
  call GETTKN and only if a non all else token is returned or if
  DELIMSTATE is not a delimiter does this procedure need to do anything
  different.  Especially useful for getting filenames that begin with digits
  or have hyphens in the name.
    Same return codes as from GETTKN.  The quoted string option of GETTKN
  can be used to behave similarily, but this frees the user from having
  to remember to quote such strings himself.

PROCEDURE GETTKNEOL(VAR tpv : TKNPTRTYP; VAR TOKEN : BUFTYP; VAR RETCOD : CARDINAL);
(*
GET ToKeN to EndOfLine.
This will build a token that consists of every character left on the line.
That is, it only stops at the end of line.
The TRIM procedure is used to set the COUNT and LENGTH fields.  This is
the only TOKENIZE procedure that uses it.

************************************** UNGETTKN *****************************
UNGET TOKEN ROUTINE.
This routine will unget the last token fetched.  It does this by restoring
the previous value of POSN, held in PREVPOSN.  Only the last token fetched
can be ungotten, so PREVPOSN is reset after use.  If PREVPOSN contains this
as its value, then the unget operation will fail with a non-zero return
code.  if the operation is successful, then the return code will be zero.
