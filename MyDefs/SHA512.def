(* a SHA512 hash is 64 bytes.
   data is an open array so that you can implement a single buffer
   large enough to hold different hashes, each of which is likely a different
   size in bytes.
   this call will Finalize the hash if it has not yet been finalized.

  returns TRUE if the implemented algorithm properly operates.
  this call is only useful when porting this code to some other processor/compiler.
