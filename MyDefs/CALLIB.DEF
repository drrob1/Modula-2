PROCEDURE GREG2JUL(M,D,Y : CARDINAL; VAR JULDATE : LONGREAL);

******************************* GREG2JUL *********************************
Gregorian To Julian Date Conversion Routine.
This routine computes the Julian Date from the standard calendar date
format.  The formula is J := [365.25 Y0] + [30.6001 M0] + D + 1,720,982.
Y0 and M0 are the modified year and month, to account for the changes
imposed by leap years.
Reals must be used because the size and precision required to manipulate the
Julian dates exceeds that of cards or ints.  Longcards would obviate this
problem, but V2.0 of Logitech's Mod-2 compiler does not support them.

If the result returned is zero, one of the input params to the subroutine
was out of range.

INPUT FROM GLOBAL VAR'S : FUDGEFACTOR.

PROCEDURE JUL2GREG(JULDATE : LONGREAL; VAR M,D,Y : CARDINAL);
(*
************************************ JUL2GREG ***************************
Julian to Gregorian Date Conversion Routine.
This converts from the Julian date back to the conventional date format.

Year will be returned as zero if JULDATE was out of range.

INPUT FROM GLOBAL VAR'S : FUDGEFACTOR.

PROCEDURE GETMDY(INBUF : BUFTYP; VAR M,D,Y : CARDINAL);
(*
********************************** GETMDY *****************************
GET MONTH DAY YEAR.
This procedure parses the input string into the month, day and year.  Any
delimiters can be used because the parsing process uses a finite state
automata algorithm (part of the TOKENIZE module) to parse the input line.
If an error occurs, then Y is returned as zero.
